# Code-Portfolio-2023
These works are my master degree's coursework through all over 3 semesters.
These files reflect the projects I've worked on this academic year, ranging from relatively basic implementations of Python features to tensorflow-based deep reinforcement learning networks. From basic java development of the game connect4 to relatively large game projects developed for Unity game projects. The final project, Exergame, is a reflection of how I used SteamVR, bluetooth, and api to create a dynamically adjustable difficulty VR sport cycling game.
