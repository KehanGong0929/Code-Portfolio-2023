# **rl_Pong**


#### _Assuming you have python and pip already installed_

For RL project the team implemented DQN, A2C and PPO to test it on the PONG-v5 OpenAI Atari game.

### Requirement 
#### ALE Pong -v5 installed from the OpenAI game
#### Pytorch and Tensorflow installed 

The aim of this repository is test all the three algorithms on the Pong environment and to learn about how the agent performed . 

This Repository contains the folder of all the three algorithms - DQN , A2C and PPO implemented and tested on the environment. Below is the clip from the PPO algorithm which performed better on this environment.
